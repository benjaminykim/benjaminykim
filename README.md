<br />

I'm Ben. Crypto maximalist, nft enthusiast. I build nft's and develop for blockchain in my free time. Moving into DAOs and defi protocols soon.

I am also a fullstack engineer. I took two years away from my Data Science degree at UC Berkeley to work in tech. I'll graduate in Spring 2022.

Hire me or ping me about your cool decentralized projects: [email](mailto:1996byk@gmail.com?subject=Hi!) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-kim-740412149/)
